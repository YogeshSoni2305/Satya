        "deepseek_response": ": Unverifiable  \nReasoning: No reputable news outlets (e.g., Times of India, Hindustan Times, Reuters) have reported an incident of Aakash Ambani hitting an Aston Martin in Mumbai; the claim appears only in unverified social‑media posts.  \nSources: (1) Absence of coverage in major Indian news archives; (2) Fact‑check databases (e.g., Alt News) show no record of such an event.",
        "llama_response": "Critique: \nThe reasoning relies heavily on the absence of coverage in major Indian news archives, which, while suggestive, is not conclusive. It's possible that a smaller news outlet or local publication might have reported the incident without being picked up by larger national news outlets.",
