        "deepseek_response": ": Unverifiable  \nReasoning: A comprehensive search of reputable Indian news outlets (e.g., The Hindu, Times of India, NDTV) and legal databases shows no documented accusation against Prajwal Revanna for operating a sex‑exploitation racket in Hassan. Without verifiable reporting, the claim cannot be confirmed.  \nSources: None found in major news archives.",
        "llama_response": "Critique: \nThe verdict relies heavily on the absence of reported evidence, which is not conclusive proof of the claim's falsity. Other potential sources, such as local or low-profile publications, might still exist but were not searched. The reasoning may be overdependent on unsearched information.",
